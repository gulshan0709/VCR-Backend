 <--how submit form data from front-end to back-end api.-->

 step-1 -- Using class component.

	1.1). 	  Create your form inside return method of render function
		  for exe:- <form method="POST" OnSubmit={submithandler}></form>
		  Note:-    submithandler is a function which will be written below the constructor.

	1.2).     Every input <tag> must have its own handle
		  for exe:- <input type="text" name="">
			    onChange={namehandler}
			    onSubmit={namehandler}

	1.3).     Required create handler for submit button
		  for exe:- <button type="submit" onClick={clickhandler}>click me</button>

	1.4).     Handler function are made to set the event as target value for our satate variables.

	1.5).  	  You make arrow function() =>{}then there is no need to bind events in constructor.
		  otherwise every handler has to be binded.
		  for exe:- construcotor()
			    {
			      super();
			      this.stat={
				name:' ',
				
				}
				this.namehandler=this.namehandler.bind(this)
			    }
                            namehandler()
			    {this.setState({name:e.target.value})}
		  Note:- create as many state variables as form element.

	1.6).     Change of state can either be done in repective handlers or during mounting stage but componentdidmount is render only once.	

	1.7).	  Use axios.post('url').then()to submit the data backend Api using the url
